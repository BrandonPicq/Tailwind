Paris' Louvre museum to increase ticket price for visitors from outside the EU

PARIS (AP) — Paris' Louvre museum has approved a ticket hike from €22 to €32 for non-European visitors from January to help finance an overhaul of the building whose degradation has been exposed by the Oct. 19 crown jewels heist.

The measure comes as other major cultural sites across the country, including the Palace of Versailles, are considering similar moves to bring extra money needed for costly maintenance and renovation.

The Louvre ticketing changes come as part of a decade-long plan to modernize the museum. Security breaches that allowed the €88 million-euro theft highlighted the urgency of the situation.

On Friday, a suspect in the Louvre robbery was handed preliminary charges of theft by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy, the Paris prosecutor said Friday, meaning all four alleged members of the team caught on camera stealing the jewels are in custody.

From Jan. 14, nationals from outside the European Union will have to pay €10 more. The measure was approved Thursday by the Louvre governing board. Nationals from Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, countries that signed up to the European Economic Area agreement, will be exempted from the hike.
